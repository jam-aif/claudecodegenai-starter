**📝 For tool installation (Supabase CLI, Node.js, Git):** See [SETUP_MACOS.md](./SETUP_MACOS.md)

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a new repo from the template

1. Go to https://github.com/AIFundTeam/genai-starter and click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
2. Clone your new repository and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

### 2. Create Supabase Project and Cloudflare Account

#### Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com) and create a new project
   - Enter your project details and wait for the database to launch
   - **IMPORTANT**: Save your database password when creating the project (you can reset it later in Database Settings if needed)

2. Get your access token for deployments:
   - Go to [app.supabase.com/account/tokens](https://app.supabase.com/account/tokens)
   - Generate a new token and save it securely

#### Create Cloudflare Account

1. Go to [dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and create a new account

### 3. Setup Environment

```bash
cp env.config.template env.config
```

Edit `env.config` and fill in your credentials:

**Supabase Values** (from your Supabase project):
- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` - Project Settings → General → Project ID
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Project Settings → API Keys → anon public
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Project Settings → API Keys → service_role secret
- `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` - The password you saved when creating the project
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` - The personal access token you created in step 2

**Cloudflare Values**:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Create one following these steps:
  1. Go to [My Profile → API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
  2. Click "Create Token"
  3. Select "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template → "Use template"
  4. **Account Resources**: Include → Your account
  5. **Zone Resources**: Include → All zones
  6. Click "Continue to summary" → "Create Token"
  7. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token secret immediately (it's only shown once!)
- `CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME` - Choose a name for your project (e.g., "my-app") - this will be used in your deployment URL

**OpenAI Values**:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Get from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### 4. Setup Database

```bash
# Run the database setup (WARNING: drops existing tables!)
./setup_database.sh
```

**Important**: This script is idempotent but destructive - it drops and recreates all tables each time it runs. This ensures a clean state but will DELETE ALL DATA.

### 5. Deploy

```bash
./deploy_backend.sh      # Deploy Supabase Edge Functions (automatically handles all setup)
./deploy_frontend.sh     # Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (automatically handles all setup)
```

The deploy scripts automatically handle:
- Loading environment variables from `env.config`
- Linking your Supabase project
- Generating `frontend/env.js` for the frontend
- Creating `.mcp.json` for Claude Code MCP servers
- Setting up all necessary configurations

### 6. Test Your Setup

After deploying, verify everything is working by visiting your Cloudflare Pages URL.

The template includes a **Test Your Setup** section on the dashboard that verifies:

1. ✅ **Frontend** - Confirms deployment is working
2. ✅ **Database** - Tests connection to PostgreSQL  
3. ✅ **Edge Functions** - Tests both public and user APIs
4. ✅ **LLM Integration** - Tests OpenAI API integration

The LLM test verifies your OpenAI API key is working. If it fails:
1. Check your API key is valid and has credits
2. Make sure you ran `./deploy_backend.sh` after setting up
3. Verify the secret was set: `supabase secrets list`

Once all tests pass, you'll see "🎉 All Tests Passed!" and you're ready to customize your app.

### Troubleshooting Test Failures

If any tests fail, here's how to debug with Claude Code:

1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
2. **Check the Console tab** for error messages
3. **Copy the error messages** (right-click → "Copy message" or select and copy)
4. **Paste the errors** and ask Claude Code:
   ```
   "I'm getting these console errors when running the setup tests:
   [paste your error messages here]
   
   Can you help me debug and fix this?"
   ```

**Additional debugging steps:**
- **Network tab**: Check for failed API requests (red entries)
- **Application tab**: Verify localStorage has `userEmail` set
- **Sources tab**: Check if all JavaScript files are loading correctly

**Common fixes Claude Code might suggest:**
- Environment variable issues (`env.js` missing or incorrect)
- API key problems (expired, invalid, or missing credits)
- CORS configuration issues
- Database connection problems
- Edge function deployment issues

## Using Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI-powered coding assistant that can help you build, debug, and enhance your applications. It understands your entire codebase and can write code, modify files, run commands, and deploy changes.

To start using Claude Code with your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

Examples of what to ask Claude Code:
- "I want to build a task management app"
- "Add a user profile system"
- "Create a real-time chat feature"
- "Implement file uploads"
- "Add data export functionality"

Claude Code will:
- Update the database schema in `sql/schema.sql`
- Modify the frontend UI in `index.html` and `index.js`
- Add edge functions for your business logic
- Implement features across the entire stack
- Maintain consistency with the existing codebase

**Important**: After Claude Code modifies the schema, run `./setup_database.sh` again to apply the changes.

## Development with Claude Code

Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Feature Development
"Add a comments system to items with real-time updates"
"Create a search functionality with full-text search"
"Implement user notifications with email integration"

# Debugging
"Why is my authentication redirect not working?"
"Help me debug this CORS error in my edge function"

# Performance
"Optimize the database queries for the dashboard"
"Add caching to improve page load times"

# Testing
"Write tests for the authentication flow"
"Create a test suite for my edge functions"
```

### Local Frontend Development

```bash
# Simple HTTP server (Python)
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000

# Or use any static server like Live Server in VS Code
```

### Test Edge Functions

```bash
# Public endpoint
curl https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/hello-world

# User endpoint (no auth required, just pass user email)
curl https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/user-endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_email": "user@example.com"}'
```

## Customization

### Building Your App - The Claude Code Way

```bash
# Build your main app
"Build a project management app with tasks and deadlines"

# Add features
"Add a kanban board view to the tasks"

# Add an edge function
"Add an API endpoint to export user data as CSV"

# Database changes
"Add a tags system to items with many-to-many relationships"
```

Claude Code will handle:
- Modifying index.html/js for your app
- Creating edge functions
- Adding RLS policies
- Updating the schema
- Maintaining consistency


## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit** `env.config` (it's in .gitignore)
2. **Use RLS policies** on all database tables (though open for this template)
3. **Validate inputs** in edge functions
4. **Keep API keys secure** - never expose in frontend code
5. **Store secrets** in Supabase Edge Function secrets, not in code

## Working with Claude Code

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific** - Claude Code works best with clear, specific requests
2. **Iterate Quickly** - Make small changes and test frequently
3. **Use the CLAUDE.md** - It contains project-specific instructions
4. **Trust the Assistant** - Claude Code understands the entire codebase
5. **Document Your Vision First** - Before coding, write down what you hope to accomplish in a narrative document. Use this to align on goals with teammates. Often the alignment process is both time-consuming and the most important part of any project. Once this narrative document is locked down, Claude Code can often execute on it in a single pass.

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Start a new feature
claude "I need a blog system with markdown support"

# Claude Code will:
# 1. Create database tables for posts, categories, tags
# 2. Add RLS policies for authorization
# 3. Create edge functions for CRUD operations
# 4. Build the frontend UI with markdown editor
# 5. Set up real-time updates for comments

# Review and deploy
claude "Show me what changed and deploy to production"
```
